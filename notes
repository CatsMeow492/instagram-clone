These are my personal notes. Normally any terminal commands I use to add libraries or tools I'll put in here a long with other bits of code I thought were particularly interesting or useful.

npx create-react-app@lastest instagram-clone

yarn add styled-components
yarn add react-router-dom
yarn add firebase
yarn add firebase-tools
yarn add react-redux    
yarn add @reduxjs/toolkit
yarn add react-slick
yarn add slick-carousel
npm install -g firebase-tools
yarn add @emotion/react
npm install @mui/material
yarn add @emotion/styled
npm i react-instagram-embed

ColorZilla

rfce (tab)

object-fit: contain;

.onSnapshot(snapshot => {
    This is a neat function that fires everytime something changes in the db
})

updated import statements for MUI were kind of a nightmare to find.  For future projects; 

import { Button, Input, Box } from '@material-ui/core';
